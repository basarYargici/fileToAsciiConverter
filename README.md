# fileToAsciiConverter
 * Write a C program including necessary functions to convert a binary
  file to a text file. Finally, your program will write the bit representation
  of each byte in the binary file to the text file in a way that there will be
  8 ‘1’ or ‘0’ characters at each line. You will not modify the binary file.
  Prove by examples that your algorithm works well.
